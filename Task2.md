Report Of Task 2

Statement: 1 Verify presence of spe ling or grammar errors.
Checked!(Yes! both trendingprofessional@gmail.com and
trendingprofessionals@gmail.com exist sounds suspicious)

Statement : 2 Note any mismatched URLs (hover to see real link).
Checked! (No!)

Statement : 3 Identify suspicious links or attachments. Checked! (Yes! I
identify a attachment the offer letter of Internship. making me to
quickly open the attachment)

Statement : 4 Look for urgent or threatening language in the email body.
Checked! (Yes! It shows urgency)

Statement : 5 Check email headers for discrepancies (using online header
analyzer). checked! (Done! Through Messageheader Olnile tool:
toolbox.googleapps.com)

Statement: 6 Summarize phishing traits found in the email!
1) Sender is suspicious: The email says it's from "trending professional" but it's
just a regular Gmail account. Legit companies won't use Gmail for
official stuff, they'll have their own domain like
@trendingprofessionals.com.
2) Weird attachment: They slapped a PDF on
it outta nowhere. No prior chat, no confirmation. Random PDFs = malware
playground. Definitely don't click it.
3) Overly friendly hype:
"Congrats! ... acknowledge the same on return mail." Classic phishing
trick -- they hype me up so I act fast and don't think even a second.
Basically trying to get you to open the attachment and reply without
checking.
4) No real signature: No logo, no address, no phone number, no
website. Legit HR emails always give you proper contact info.
5)
Technical stuff: SPF/DKIM/DMARC all green but that doesn't mean it's
safe. Gmail servers can send phishing emails too. Just because it's
authenticated, doesn't mean it's legit.

Statement: 7 Examine sender's email address for spoofing.
