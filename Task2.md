# Report of Task 2

## Statement 1: Verify presence of spelling or grammar errors
**Checked!**  
Yes! Both `trendingprofessional@gmail.com` and `trendingprofessionals@gmail.com` exist, which sounds suspicious.

## Statement 2: Note any mismatched URLs (hover to see real link)
**Checked!**  
No mismatched URLs found.

## Statement 3: Identify suspicious links or attachments
**Checked!**  
Yes! I identified an attachment—the offer letter for the internship. It seemed designed to make me quickly open it.

## Statement 4: Look for urgent or threatening language in the email body
**Checked!**  
Yes! The email emphasizes urgency.

## Statement 5: Check email headers for discrepancies (using online header analyzer)
**Checked!**  
Done! Analyzed through Message Header Online tool: [toolbox.googleapps.com](https://toolbox.googleapps.com).

## Statement 6: Summarize phishing traits found in the email
1. **Suspicious sender**: The email claims to be from "trending professional" but comes from a regular Gmail account. Legit companies usually use their own domain (e.g., `@trendingprofessionals.com`).  
2. **Weird attachment**: Random PDF included without prior communication or confirmation. Random PDFs are a common malware vector.  
3. **Overly friendly hype**: Phrases like *"Congrats! ... acknowledge the same on return mail"* are classic phishing tactics—they rush you to act without thinking.  
4. **No real signature**: Missing logo, address, phone number, and website. Legit HR emails provide proper contact information.  
5. **Technical details**: SPF/DKIM/DMARC all green, but that doesn’t guarantee safety. Phishing emails can still pass authentication checks.

## Statement 7: Examine sender's email address for spoofing
**Checked!**  
Sorry! Unable to perform this task.
